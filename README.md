#### Requirements:
- A _render()_ function that loops through the array and displays each book on the page
- A form that allows user to add new books
- A delete button.
- A button to handle the read status of the book

#### What I learned:
- The basics of localStorage by using the Mozilla documentation
and also about JSON _stringify_ and _parse_ methods which made handling the data extremely easy.
- How use Object Constructors to reduce the code. 
- Better knowledge of Javascript.
