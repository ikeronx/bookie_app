# Overview
<strong>BoOkie</strong> is a single-page CRUD application that allows a user to add, edit, delete, and save books. The books are saved in local storage via the Web Storage API so the user still has access to the books even they close the browser or reload the page.<br>

# Why did I choose to build this project?
My relatives, friends, and I included have struggled with keeping track of books we've read so I decided to create boOkie to solve this problem. Additionally, doing courses and tutorials is great, but sometimes is difficult to evaluate how much are we actually learning. Watching video after video and coding along with the instructor gives us very good guidance, but it is not a realistic scenario. In a real-world job, we will have to solve problems and start figuring things out by ourselves (with the help of Google, of course, ðŸ˜‰). So, to test how much I was actually learning during the JavaScript course I was doing I decided to make a simple To-Do type app in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript which turned into a full-out CRUD app after I implemented the update feature.

# What did I want to implement in the project?
#### I decided to apply the following concepts around Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
* Classes
* Properties

#### I also wanted to experiment with DOM manipulation, and practice creating my own HTML elements from scratch...

* A form that allows users to add new books.
* A button to handle the read status of the book
* A update/edit button so users can update the book's info.
* A delete button.
* Books are stored in localStorage on the user's web browser so the user will still have access to the books even they close the browser or reload the page.



 # What I learned
* This was the first time I coded following the OOP paradigm and, despite feeling a bit out of my element, I now can see the potential that following this paradigm has.
* I learned about the importance of structuring HTML in a meaningful semantic way, and how a good HTML structure can make our lives easy when we start working on CSS and JavaScript in later stages of the project.
* I learned how to build a CRUD app by implementing an edit/update feature for the app which was a challenge in itself.ðŸ˜¤
* I learned how to create HTML elements from scratch by using JavaScript. 
* I also learned how to use localStorage to save the data for each book on the user's web browser so the user still has access to the books even they close the browser or reload the page.
