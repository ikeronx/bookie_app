# Why did I choose to build this project?
My relatives, friends, and I have struggled with keeping track of books we've read so I decided to create boOkie to solve this problem. Additionally, doing courses and tutorials is great, but sometimes is difficult to evaluate how much are we actually learning. Watching video after video and coding along with the instructor gives us very good guidance, but it is not a realistic scenario. In a real-world job, we will have to solve problems and start figuring things out by ourselves (with the help of Google, of course, 😉). So, to test how much I was actually learning during the JavaScript course I was doing I decided to make a simple To-Do type app in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript which turned into a full-out CRUD app after I implemented the update feature.


# What did I want to implement in the project?
I decided to apply the following concepts around Object Oriented Programming (OOP):
* Classes
* Properties

I also wanted to experiment with DOM manipulation, and practice creating my own HTML elements from scratch and rendering in vanilla JavaScript:

 And the Web Storage Api:

* A form that allows users to add new books.
* A button to handle the read status of the book
* A update button so users can update or edit the the book's info.
* A remove button so users can delete books.
* Local storage, via the web storage API, books stored on the browser can be accessed by users after they close the browser or reload the webpage. 



# What I learned
* This was the first time I coded following the OOP paradigm and, despite feeling a bit out of my element, I now can see the potential that following this paradigm has.
* I learned about the importance of structuring HTML in a meaningful semantic way, and how a good HTML structure can make our lives easy when we start working on CSS and JavaScript in later stages of the project.
* I learned how to build a CRUD app by implementing an edit/update feature which was a challenge in itself. 😩
* I learned how to create HTML elements from scratch. 
* I also learned how to use localStorage to save the data on the user's web browser.
